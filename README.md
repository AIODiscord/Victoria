ðŸŒ‹ - Lavalink wrapper for Discord.NET. Provides more options and performs better than Lavalink.NET and Sharplink combined.

---


## ðŸ”§`What Is It?`
Victoria is a Lavalink wrapper for Discord.NET library. It uses Emzi's code style while keeping it simple like sharplink.
Even though Sharplink is great, there were constant internal exceptions and weird code style. Victoria aims to solve that and also provide full support of Lavalink.

## ðŸ¤” `How To Use It?`
Please refer to Wiki for v3 guide.

## ðŸ’¡ `I Want X Feature In Victoria!`
You can open an issue and describe your feature with massive details and make sure your feature is required on global scale.

## ðŸš€ `I Like Victoria! How Can I Support Her?!`
GREAT! SMASH THAT :star: BUTTON, HIT THE :eyes: (watch) BUTTON. Or, you can [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Yucked) for my hardwork.
OR you can spread the word about Victoria. None of them are necessary but it would be greatly appreciated.
