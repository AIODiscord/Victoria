ðŸŒ‹ - Lavalink wrapper for Discord.NET. Provides more options and performs better than Lavalink.NET and Sharplink combined.

---


## ðŸ”§`What Is It?`
Victoria is a Lavalink wrapper for Discord.NET library. It uses Emzi's code style while keeping it simple like sharplink.
Even though Sharplink is great, there were constant internal exceptions and weird code style. Victoria aims to solve that and also provide full support of Lavalink.

OR you can spread the word about Victoria. None of them are necessary but it would be greatly appreciated.
